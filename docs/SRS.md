# Software Requirements Specification

<br />

# 1. Introduction

##1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification was created to collect and organize the requirements for the dashup platform.
Agreeing on a general consent between the developer teams expertise and the clients interests and expectations, the 
specification contains all realistic requirements, that are compatible with the projects vision. Therefore it describes 
the expected functional and nonfunctional requirements of the platform and makes it transparent to the community, who can 
therefore gain a better overview over the projects scope. Furthermore it is needed to evaluate the results of the project 
after its status is considered to be completed and ready for transition. 

##1.2 Scope

The dashup platform provides a quick overview of multiple microservices hosted on external servers of different providers.
Therefore users no longer have to access microservices on separated ways and can gain quick insights into real time data 
of different microservices on one central platform. Furthermore, dashup provides a compressed pool of functionalities for each
microservice. Dashup is therefore considered to be a productivity tool, running as a web-application on modern browsers.
Each microservice will be displayed on the central dashboard by its individual panel containing different components for 
data visualization. Whereas users are provided with a collection of default microservices at the beginning, they can later 
enhance their dashboard with further microservices from the dashup store. In addition, there should be the possibility to 
integrate own microservices as customly defined panels to keep track of all of one's own applications.

##1.5 Overview

In the next chapter, the general vision as well as the UCD will be provided, in order to give a quick summary about the 
scope of the project. The more in depth specification of the project will follow in the chapter <i>Specific Requirements</i>.
Every feature that dashup provides, will be described and explained in chapter <i>Functionality</i> going over to <i>Usability</i>
and <i>Reliability</i> claims of dashup. Furthermore, <i>Performance</i>, <i>Supportability</i> and <i>Design constraints</i> 
will be a part of the specification, giving information about our service level agreements. In order to meet the expectations 
of basic users and developers, <i>Documentation and Help System Requirements</i> will also play a big role within this SRS. 
<i>Purchased components</i>, <i>hardware interfaces</i> as well as <i>Licensing Requirements</i> 
are minor topics or not applicable for the dashup project and will therefore not be a part of this specification. Other 
interfaces like <i> User-, Software- and Communication-Interfaces</i> on the other hand, will be described in chapter 
<i>Interfaces</i>. To finish of the specification, the <i>Legal, Copyright, and Other</i> chapter as well as <i>Applicable Standards</i> 
offer insights in our coding creeds and the allowed range of usage of our application. If any questions are left open or 
an adaption of the SRS in needed, please contact one of the developers listed in <i>Further information</i>.

#2 Overall Description

##2.1 Project Vision

In today's digital world, automation is everything. To keep up with modern achievement-oriented society, people need to 
accomplish daily tasks and planning more efficiently. Therefore people are used to create multiple personal productivity tools. 
Keeping an overview over your own pool of applications might occur difficult sometimes. Inspired by this efficiency loss, 
we will create dashup to give you the ultimate tool to get back on track again.

Dashup helps you to get through daily tasks easier by providing various microservices for typical private usage scenarios on a central platform. 
By fetching relevant information of each microservice, dashup saves you from spending too much time on analyzing data or 
using applications. You can take use of each microservice restricted to the essential set of features or get insights into 
real time processed data quickly , thus leading to more efficiency. Each microservice will be displayed as its own panel 
on the central dashboard. 

Additionally, dashup gives you the opportunity to create custom panels for your own microservices and to publish 
your panel for global usage.

All in all, dashup will provide you the best experience and overview over all daily productivity tools on a central platform.


##2.2 General use Case Diagram

Following UCD will provide a basic overview to the user characteristics, features, constraints, associations and dependencies 
within the project scope. Furthermore, non-functional requirements are put outside the system boundaries.

#3 Specific Requirements

\[This section of the **SRS** should contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.   When using use-case modeling, these requirements are captured in the Use-Cases and the applicable supplementary specifications.  If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for supplementary specifications may be inserted directly into this section, as shown below.\]

##3.1 Functionality


\[This section describes the functional requirements of the system for those requirements which are expressed in the natural language style. For many applications, this may constitute the bulk of the **SRS** Package and thought should be given to the organization of this section. This section is typically organized by feature, but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate, for example, organization by user or organization by subsystem.  Functional requirements may include feature sets, capabilities, and security.

Where application development tools, such as requirements tools, modeling tools, etc., are employed to capture the functionality, this section document will refer to the availability of that data, indicating the location and name of the tool that is used to capture the data.\]

### 3.1.1 <Functional Requirement One>

\[The requirement description.\]

##3.2 Usability

\[This section should include all of those requirements that affect usability. For example,

•               specify the required training time for a normal users and a power user to become productive at particular operations

•               specify measurable task times for typical tasks or base the new system’s usability requirements on other systems that the users know and like

•               specify requirement to conform to common usability standards, such as IBM’s CUA standards Microsoft’s GUI standards\]

•               Accessibility

### 3.2.1 <Usability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.3 Reliability


\[Requirements for reliability of the system should be specified here. Some suggestions follow:

•               Availability—specify the percentage of time available ( xx.xx%), hours of use, maintenance access, degraded mode operations, etc.

•               Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) — this is usually specified in hours, but it could also be specified in terms of days, months or years.

•               Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)—how long is the system allowed to be out of operation after it has failed?

•               Accuracy—specify precision (resolution) and accuracy (by some known standard) that is required in the system’s output.

•               Maximum Bugs or Defect Rate—usually expressed in terms of bugs per thousand of lines of code (bugs/KLOC) or bugs per function-point( bugs/function-point).

•               Bugs or Defect Rate—categorized in terms of minor, significant, and critical bugs: the requirement(s) must define what is meant by a “critical” bug; for example, complete loss of data or a complete inability to use certain parts of the system’s functionality.\]

### 3.3.1 <Reliability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description.\]

##3.4 Performance


\[The system’s performance characteristics should be outlined in this section. Include specific response times. Where applicable, reference related Use Cases by name.

•               response time for a transaction (average, maximum)

•               throughput, for example, transactions per second

•               capacity, for example, the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate

•               degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been degraded in some manner)

•               resource utilization, such as memory, disk, communications, etc.

### 3.4.1 <Performance Requirement One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.5 Supportability


\[This section indicates any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the system being built, including coding standards, naming conventions, class libraries, maintenance access, maintenance utilities.\]

### 3.5.1 <Supportability Requirement One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.6 Design Constraints


\[This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered to.  Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased components, class libraries, etc.\]

### 3.6.1 <Design Constraint One>

\[The requirement description goes here.\]

##3.7 On-line User Documentation and Help System Requirements


\[Describes the requirements, if any, for on-line user documentation, help systems, help about notices, etc.\]

3.8 Purchased Components
------------------------

\[This section describes any purchased components to be used with the system, any applicable licensing or usage restrictions, and any associated compatibility and interoperability or interface standards.\]

3.9 Interfaces
--------------

### 3.9.1 User Interfaces

* **Login screen** that provides input fields to login.
* **Registration screen** where he user can set up an new account.
* **Main dashboard** on which the user can see all his panels and the information provided by the microservices.
* **Profile management screen** where a user can edit and update her/his personal information.
* **Marketplace** where default and custom microservices can be found and added to own dashboard.
* **Panel editor** on which developers can create their own panels to display information from their own microservices. 

### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces

N/A

### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces

The dashup application runs in a web-browser. We will try to make it work in many different web-browsers as possible.

### 3.9.4 Communications Interfaces

The webapplication should communicate with the java backend by a secured HTTPS connection on Port 443. If there should 
be a unencrypted connection via HTTP is still to be determined. The Connection should be asynchronous to avoid a reload 
of the webapplication.   

##3.10 Licensing Requirements


tbd

##3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices

The dashup team will not take any responsibility for lost data and other damages done to your microservice or other programs. 
The dashup logo may only be used for the official dashup application. The copy of the idea or any kind of coding belonging 
to the dashup application is strictly forbidden and will be taken to court.

##3.12 Applicable Standards

The code of dashup should follow some basic rules of clean code such as:
* Intuitive names of variables and methods.
* Comments to improve understanding and readability of the code.
* Design patterns integration.
* No hard-coded strings.
* No premature optimization.
* Secure transfer of data

If necessary there can be exceptions to this rules, but they have to be well considered and discussed.
